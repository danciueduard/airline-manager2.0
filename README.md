# AirlineManager20

Airline Manager 2.0

An airline manager browser game that will allow the user to purchase planes, hire staff, manage airports, create and manage routes, implement multiplayer, enable trade and mouch more.
For the map I used Leaflet and for the DB I will use Supabase.
The game is made out of pure passion for aviation and it's ment to be a browser game at first and later if it's possible to be converted in an android/iOS app.

Possible features and fixes

- implement multiplayer
- allow to add friends
- implement chat
- add events (bad weather, mechanical problems, staff issues, all based on how good you manage your company)
- add discounts
- manage ground services
- making the page responsive for all devices
  and more...

The Map is provided by Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. (https://leafletjs.com/)
